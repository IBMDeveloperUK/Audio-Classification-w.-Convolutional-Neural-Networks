    "\n",
    "First, we have `model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), input_shape=input_shape))` which, as the code suggests, creates a 2D convolutional layer. A convolutional layers job is to take an input (in this case, our image) and to essentially move around areas of it (convolve around) and tally up all of the values in that section of the image. Imagine you have a photo and a small square, if you were to place the square over a part of the image and tally up all of the values of the image inside the grid you would get a single number. If you repeat this process for all of the remaining parts of the image, you would end up with a matrix of numbers which you would then pass on to the next layer of our network. You can think of it as a filter. Our image goes in, the **_key features_** of our image are what is output, and that's what's important - we're hoping (and hope is the right word here) that our convolutional layer will be able to pick out the key features of our spectrograms as we show it more and more of them. This layer has `32` outputs, so we're greatly reducing the amount of information (A 110x110 image has 12,100 data points) passing from our source to the next layer of our network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up, we have `model.add(Activation('relu'))`. This creates a layer of densely connected tensors (that is, a series of tensors which connects to every input and output before it) that will be activated with the **ReLu** function. The **ReLu** activation function is generally the go-to choice of activation functions when building convolutional neural networks. It's uncomplicated (it ignores negative input values), so it's computationally cheap to process, meaning we can usually train our networks faster with results comparative to networks built with other activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have `model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))`. A pooling layer take only the highest values of a section of the inputs. Essentialluy this is a downsampling function which only allows the most prominent features of the inputs to remain. In this pooling layer, we're passing a pool size of `2x2`, that is, we're dividing the images into quadrants and passing the maximum values found in those quandrants to the next layer of our neural network."

    "By adding more neurons to our convolution layer in `model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3)))` we create in our network the possibility of exploring more higher level features. If we're looking for images of cats, we can imagine the first layers in the first group of layers of our neural network would have identified the edges of objects. The second and third groups of convolutional layer gives our network the opportunity to explore connections between different features identified in the first group of layers. So, as opposed to finding the edge of features in an image, the network can start to look at the relationships between those featurs identified in the first group of layers in our network. Going back to thinking about cats, it's a bit like being able to say \"This thing has ears (identification made in our first layer) but it also has four paws (exposed by the greater feature exploration enabled in our second layer)\" "
